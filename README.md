# COMP432-GroupM

# Description

This project involves the study of a computer vision task using deep learning CNNs with the aim to solve image classification problems in the real world. The code in this repository trains a ResNet18 CNN model from PyTorch on a dataset from the medical field. This dataset contains Colorectal Cancer images. The results of the training are shown in terms of performance metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and such. t-SNE is used for visualising feature extraction done by the CNN model and the result can be seen in the code output. This pretrained ResNet18 model along with another CNN model from ImageNet are used to visualise feature extraction done on two new datasets, containing Prostate Cancer and animal faces images. KNN clustering for unsupervised learning and SVM for supervised learning are then applied to the two new datasets for classification and the results are reported.
